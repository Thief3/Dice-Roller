# Activity Tracker

A [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame) (Clojurescript) application
designed as a client-side app, for keeping track of dice rolls and effects in
boardgames (specifically designed for Binding of Issac Four Souls.)

[Demo of the app.](readme_resources/demo.gif)

## Environment Setup

1. Install [JDK 8 or later](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) (Java Development Kit)
2. Install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/#install) (Clojure/ClojureScript project task &
dependency management)
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (JavaScript runtime environment) which should include
   [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) or if your Node.js installation does not include NPM also install it.
7. Clone this repo and open a terminal in the `dice-roller` project root directory
8. (Optional) Download project dependencies:
    ```sh
    lein deps
    ```
    
## Development

### Running the App

Start a temporary local web server, build the app with the `dev` profile, and serve the app with
hot reload:

```sh
lein dev
```

or my custom script:

```sh
run-dev.bat
```

Please be patient; it may take over 20 seconds to see any output, and over 40 seconds to complete.

When `[:app] Build completed` appears in the output, browse to
[http://localhost:8280/](http://localhost:8280/).

[`shadow-cljs`](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) will automatically push ClojureScript code
changes to your browser on save. To prevent a few common issues, see
[Hot Reload in ClojureScript: Things to avoid](https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2019/08/25/hot-reload-in-clojurescript.html#things-to-avoid).

Opening the app in your browser starts a
[ClojureScript browser REPL](https://clojurescript.org/reference/repl#using-the-browser-as-an-evaluation-environment),
to which you may now connect.

## Production

Build the app with the `prod` profile:

```sh
lein prod
```

Please be patient; it may take over 15 seconds to see any output, and over 30 seconds to complete.

The `resources/public/js/compiled` directory is created, containing the compiled `app.js` and
`manifest.edn` files.

The [`resources/public`](resources/public/) directory contains the complete, production web front
end of your app.

Always inspect the `resources/public/js/compiled` directory prior to deploying the app. Running any
`lein` alias in this project after `lein dev` will, at the very least, run `lein clean`, which
deletes this generated directory. Further, running `lein dev` will generate many, much larger
development versions of the files in this directory.
